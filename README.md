This is the best migrator for migrating WordPress export to Hugo.
It handles several weird edge cases that I encountered while trying to migrate my [personal website](https://v1.ashishb.net) to [Hugo-based site](https://v2.ashishb.net/).

While this primarily targets Hugo-based code generation, one can use it to convert WordPress blogs to Markdown-based files that can be used with other systems,
for example, [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Why existing tools don't work

[Existing tools](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/) do a half-baked job of migrating content.
They rarely migrate the metadata like GUID, YouTube embeds, Google Map embeds, and code embeds properly.

## Hugo Manager

This repository contains an experimental tool, `hugomanager`.
I use this tool for the automatic generation of URLs from the title as well as for knowing which blog posts are still
marked as drafts or which ones are scheduled to be published soon.

You can build that via

```bash
src/wp2hugo $ make build_hugo_manager
...
```

```bash
src/wp2hugo $ ./bin/hugomanager
A tool for managing Hugo sites e.g. adding URL suggestions, generating site status summary etc.

Usage:
  hugomanager [command]

Available Commands:
  completion                            Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help                                  Help about any command
  make-absolute-internal-links-relative Converts all the absolute internal links to relative links
  move-post-next-to-attachments         Move markdown blog posts with attachments to a single directory
  sitesummary                           Print site stats (e.g. number of posts, number of drafts etc.)
  suggest-description                   Suggests description for all the posts that are missing a description in the front matter
  suggest-image-alt                     Suggests image alt text for all the images if missing
  suggest-url                           Suggests URLs for all the pending/future posts that are missing a URL
  version                               Print the version number of HugoManager

Flags:
  -a, --author string    author name for copyright attribution (default "YOUR NAME")
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.cobra.yaml)
  -h, --help             help for hugomanager
  -l, --license string   name of license for the project
      --viper            use Viper for configuration (default true)
```
